h1. measurement

A sweet Ruby measurement & converstion Library.

h2. Introduction

Measurement is a library I wrote ages ago, in large part to play with metaprogramming.

But its cool. All of the measurements and conversions are in yaml files, stored in lib/measurements.  This lets me have fun with SI prefixes and such. Ideally these files would be a separate project, to be used by other languages, but that's for another day.

h2. What can it do?

Conversions.

<code><pre>
> include Measurement::Length
> Inch.new(12).to_centimeters
=> #<Measurement::Length::Centimeter:0x173c2b4 @units=30.48>
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
> include Measurement::Volume
> Milliliter.new(100).to_teaspoons
=> #<Measurement::Volume::Teaspoon:0x1720e88 @units=45.0>
</pre></code>

Check the yaml files to see what's available, but note that SI prefixes (mega-, kilo-, yotta-, etc.) are applied magically, as are base2 prefixes for data.


h3.  What's next?

Dunno, have ideas?  Send me a message via github.  I'm reviving the project after over a year, so its time to have some fun.

Some of my plans:

* More units (please add!)
* uh, tests.
